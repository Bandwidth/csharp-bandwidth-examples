## Catapult Example Applications
===

There are two examples of how to use the Bandwidth C# SDK to implement a server application.  

[Hello Flipper](./DolphinApp/README.md) demonstrates how to play audio, speak text to callers, and gather DTMF from the caller.

[Chaos Conference](./ChaosConference/README.md) is a very simple conferencing app that joins users to a conference by making outbound calls to each attendee

The README for each project details how to build each project and deploy it to Azure.  Each README also shows how to invoke the demos using simple CURL commands.
