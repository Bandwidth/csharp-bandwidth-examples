## Catapult Example Applications
===

There are two examples of how to use the Bandwidth C# SDK to implement a server application.  

[Hello Flipper](./DolphinApp/README.md) demonstrates how to play audio, speak text to callers, and gather DTMF from the caller.

[Chaos Conference](./ChaosConference/README.md) is a very simple conferencing app that joins users to a conference by making outbound calls to each attendee

[Sip App](./SipApp/README.md) is simple application which allows to make calls directly to sip account, redirect outgoing calls from sip account to another number, redirect incoming calls from specific number to sip account. Also this application demonstrate how to receive/create an application, domain, endpoint, buy phone numbers.

[Sip App](./CallApp/README.md) is simple application which allows to make 2 callback calls and bridge them.

The README for each project details how to build each project and deploy it to Azure.  Each README also shows how to invoke the demos using simple CURL commands.
